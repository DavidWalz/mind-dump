    "[Karuba Junior](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/234439/karuba-junior) is a cooperative tile-placement adventure game.\n",
    "Having lost twice in a row I wanted to calculate the odds of winning this game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules are simple. The players take turns in drawing a card and using it to extend or end one of the 4 starting roads.\n",
    "Tigers and treasures end a road.\n",
    "Forks and crossroads add one and two additional roads, respectively, as long as they are placed in such a way that none of the roads are blocked by another card, which in practice is always possible.\n",
    "The game is won if we find all 3 treasures.\n",
    "The game is lost if either there is no open road left, or if the pirates advanced a total of 9 fields, which happens by drawing the corresponding pirate cards. Let's find the odds of winning the game. \n",

    "* 3 treasures\n",
    "* 3 tigers\n",
    "* 11 straight and curved roads\n",

    "For each card we define how the counters change in form of a 3-component vector. Then we can accumulate the changes in the random order they are drawn and determine which win/loss condition occurs first."
